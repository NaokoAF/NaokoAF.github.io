# NaokoAF.github.io
this is just a web page for me to share my social media and stuff  

the code is absolutely horrendous because i have zero idea how to do web related stuff  
and also this was my first experience with git and github in general, so the commits are absolute jank

whats matters is it gets the job done (at the cost of probably not working on like android 2.0)
